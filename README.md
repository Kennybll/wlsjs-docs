# Quickstart

### To get started you will need to get a version of WLSJS.

One is the official Gitlab Repository hosted by the BeyondBitcoin team. You can view the source [here](https://gitlab.com/beyondbitcoin/wlsjs).

Second is the UnPKG CDN, which can be used in the browser. It is located [here](https://unpkg.com/@whaleshares/wlsjs@latest/dist/steem.min.js).

Finally is the npm module [@whaleshares/wlsjs](https://npmjs.com/package/@whaleshares/wlsjs), which can be used in node.js.
